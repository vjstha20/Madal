Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a low level hardware abstraction layer to computer multimedia hardware components. Software developers can use it to write high-performance computer games and other multimedia applications that can run on many operating systems such as Android, iOS, Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and other platforms.[4]

SDL manages video, audio, input devices, CD-ROM, threads, shared object loading, networking and timers.[5] For 3D graphics it can handle an OpenGL or Direct3D context.

The library is internally written in C and, depending on the target platform, C++ or Objective-C, and provides the application programming interface in C, with bindings to other languages available.[6] It is free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the zlib License since version 2.0 and with prior versions subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License.[3] Under the zlib License, SDL 2.0 is freely available for static linking in closed-source projects, unlike SDL 1.2.[7]

SDL is extensively used in the industry in both large and small projects. Over 700 games, 180 applications, and 120 demos have also been posted on the library website.

A common misconception is that SDL is a game engine, but this is not true. However, the library is well-suited for building an engine on top of it.




Subsystems[edit]
SDL is divided into several subsystems:[18]

Basics
Initialization and Shutdown, Configuration Variables, Error Handling, Log Handling
Video
Display and Window Management, surface functions, rendering acceleration, etc.
Input Events
Event handling, Support for Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick and Game controller
Force Feedback
SDL_haptic.h implements support for "Force Feedback"
Audio
SDL_audio.h implements Audio Device Management, Playing and Recording
Threads
multi-threading: Thread Management, Thread Synchronization Primitives, Atomic Operations
Timers
Timer Support
File Abstraction
Filesystem Paths, File I/O Abstraction
Shared Object Support
Shared Object Loading and Function Lookup
Platform and CPU Information
Platform Detection, CPU Feature Detection, Byte Order and Byte Swapping, Bit Manipulation
Power Management
Power Management Status
Additional
Platform-specific functionality
Besides this basic, low-level support, there also are a few separate official libraries that provide some more functions. These comprise the "standard library", and are provided on the official website and included in the official documentation:

SDL_image — support for multiple image formats[19]
SDL_mixer — complex audio functions, mainly for sound mixing[20]
SDL_net — networking support[21]
SDL_ttf — TrueType font rendering support[22]
SDL_rtf — simple Rich Text Format rendering[23]
Other, non-standard libraries also exist. For example: SDL_Collide on S
